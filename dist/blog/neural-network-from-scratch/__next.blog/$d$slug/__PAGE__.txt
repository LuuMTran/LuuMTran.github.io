# Building a Neural Network from Scratch

In this comprehensive guide, we'll build a neural network from scratch using only NumPy. This exercise will give you deep insights into how neural networks actually work under the hood.

## Why Build From Scratch?

Understanding the fundamentals is crucial for any ML engineer. While frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch abstract away the details, knowing what's happening internally helps you:
- Debug issues more effectively
- Optimize architectures better
- Understand the mathematics behind deep learning

## The Architecture

We'll build a simple feedforward neural network with:
- Input layer
- Two hidden layers with ReLU activation
- Output layer with softmax
- Cross-entropy loss function

## Implementation

### Step 1: Initialize Parameters
```python
import numpy as np

def initialize_parameters(layer_dims):
    parameters = {}
    L = len(layer_dims)
    
    for l in range(1, L):
        parameters['W' + str(l)] = np.random.randn(layer_dims[l], layer_dims[l-1]) * 0.01
        parameters['b' + str(l)] = np.zeros((layer_dims[l], 1))
    
    return parameters
```

### Step 2: Forward Propagation
The forward pass computes the output of the network...
